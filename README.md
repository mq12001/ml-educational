# Enlightening Bugs
**Is this you?**
- Messing around with hyperparameters for your big important CNN?
- Hoping against hope that your breadth and depth settings are appropriate for this level of (2 dimensional) complexity?
- Cursing the training time that your dataset size has laden you with??

**We've all been there.** It's time to actually figure out what's going on when you tune a hyperparameter in any and every possible (***2 dimensional!!***) situation, and to have fun while doing it!
